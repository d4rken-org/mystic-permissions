# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Permission Pilot".

## Preamble

"Permission Pilot" has no internet permission and does not share user data with 3rd parties. 

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Installed application information

Permission Pilot uses the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission to gather information about installed applications and their permissions. This permission is required for the app to work. Information about installed apps is only processed locally. Permission Pilot has no internet permission and does not automatically upload data to 3rd parties. Note: Information about installed apps may be contained in manually generated [debug logs](#debug-log).

## Debug log

This app has debug functionality that can be used to assist troubleshooting efforts. It is manually triggered by the user through an option in the app settings. This feature creates a log file that contains verbose output of what the app is doing. The recorded log file can be shared with compatible apps (e.g. your email app) through the system's share dialog. As this log file may contain sensitive information (e.g. your installed applications) it should only be shared with trusted parties.
